this repository contains my [Nix](https://nixos.org) system configuration as a Nix [Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flake).
not meant to be used by anyone but me, but feel free to use as reference.

### to-do
- [ ] Reduce reliance on Home Manager to the minimum.

### relevant stuff
- [`nyanvim`](https://github.com/comfybyte/nyanvim) - my Neovim configuration, also written and built with Nix, and consumed by this flake.
- [`nixprs`](https://github.com/comfybyte/nixprs) - my collection of Nix packages, most used by this flake.
